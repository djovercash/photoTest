# Forbes Code Test: Harvard Art Gallery
Challenge: Create a image gallery using any image API of your choice.

Requirements:
- Retrieve a list of at least 50 images and display them as thumbnails on a page
- Paginate thumbnails by 10 thumbnails per page
- When clicking on an image, it should display in a modal

Technical Constraints:
- Application should be built with html/js/css
- May use pre-processors for css
- May use any build tools desired
- Application should work and run when executing `npm i && npm start` from its root directory
- No frameworks. JavaScript should be vanilla JavaScript
- Consider responsive design
- Application only needs to work in Chrome
- Include instructions for running unit tests, if applicable

# Application Goal:
Create a simple and functional application that will pull 50 images from the Harvard Art Museum Api, display 10 images at a time, and allow user to click on an image to see it larger with the reference number. In addition, allow the user to scroll through images forward and backwards, ensure the user knows what page of images they are looking at, apply responsive design (using viewpoint and media queries), and apply unit testing.

# How to Use Application:
Once downloaded or opened, type in `npm i && npm start` into your terminal. A new window will pop up and the program will begin running. To see unit testing, type `npm test` into the terminal and the tests will appear in the terminal
